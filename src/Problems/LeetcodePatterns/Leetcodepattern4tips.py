1.Think about the problem for at least 30 minutes and put in your best efforts to
solve the problem on your own.
Think through the test cases, imagine how you would be writing code and write the code without IDE

2.It’s important to
write bug-free code without using a compiler for big N companies.
I’ll explain below why I mention these very

3.The more you struggle with a problem the more you’ll learn after seeing the solution
and best case is if you look at the solution after solving it on your own.

4.Try to improve your thinking abilities, because it’s very likely that when you face the same problem weeks
later you’ll not remember the solution and you’ll most definitely think in a similar way you did the first time

--------------------------
5.VERY IMPORTANT POINT:
--------------------------
So if you learned the paradigm required to solve that problem and solved a lot of other similar problems
using that strategy you’ll actually be able to solve it later.

6.I would say try resolving random problems from past practice after a set amount of time.
Spaced repetition also helps consolidate your learnings ( firecode.io is popular because of this very fact )

7.You need to realize that it’s not about the number of problems you solved
before an interview but if "you are able to apply your learnings to a new problem" in an interview setting.

8.if you do it the correct way you won’t need to solve more than 300–400 problems to be confident
for a full-time interview, 150 for internships with a good balance of mediums ,
few hards and fewer easy ( a realistic average case figure, not talking about outliers
who only did 70 lc problems to land a big N offer ).

9.Most problems are repetitive anyway, same logic applied with a 1–2 line change.
Focus on learning core paradigms ( DP, graphs, backtracking, trees, etc )

10.It is fine if you’re not able to solve a problem
but it is important that you’re able to solve a similar problem
after absorbing the approach for the current problem.

11.It also helps us to make sure that we understood the problem correctly and I could go on and on,
just write/think through test cases first if possible :)

12. when you restrict yourself to not use the compiler, you read through your code
and try to mentally compile it, spotting logic and syntax errors on your own.
With enough practice, you don’t even make those errors and you tend to code faster.
I would say it’s good to set high standards for yourself and get out of your comfort zone

because most interviewers are sharp enough to look at your code and tell you where your bugs are.
Can you spot and fix those bugs without compiling?

--------------------------
13.VERY IMPORTANT AGAIN
--------------------------
Do look at solutions posted in discuss after solving the problem or if you’re stuck.
You’ll learn a lot by going through a few solutions,
probably learn different styles of writing the same thing or learn different approaches all together.

---------------
14.13.VERY IMPORTANT AGAIN-Related topics TAG given under each problem description
---------------
1.Don’t look at problem tags until you are stuck!
that’s part of the problem-solving process to figure out what category the problem falls into.

2.Alternatively to get good at a specific paradigm pick problems
from that tag and keep solving until you get comfortable

3.It’s a mix of these two opposite approaches
being applied alternatively that’ll set you up for success in your big N interview.


15.Maintain a google doc / excel sheet or use leetcode notes feature where you record
    1.why you couldn’t solve it,
    2.what you learned through that problem,
    3.time to get AC(Accurate code) including time to write code,
    4.time spent to think,
    5.number of times you clicked run code,
    6.number of submissions to get AC, etc.

Such statistical analysis will definitely improve your skills over time.

16.Leetcode contests for the win!

    I highly recommend doing contests every Saturday, because you’ll be trying to code faster
    as it is timed and there is a ranking system based on how quickly you get AC
    and penalties for buggy submissions

    Most leetcode contest problems were
    popular interview questions in the time period the contest
    was conducted so definitely do contests regularly
